# cat-clicker
Cat Clicker is a course project from Udacity. I developed two versions, one is using Angular framework and the other one is implemented by pure Javascript based on MV* architectures. 

During developing this project in Angular, I learned one-way data binding, two-way data binding, template-driven forms, form validation, interaction methods between parent and children components.
